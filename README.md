# YAML

JavaScript parser and stringifier for all versions of [YAML](http://yaml.org/). See the project's [documentation site](https://eemeli.org/yaml/) for more information.

Note: `yaml` 0.x and 1.x are rather different implementations. For the earlier `yaml`, see [tj/js-yaml](https://github.com/tj/js-yaml).
